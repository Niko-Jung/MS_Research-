# Master thesis in Computer Science at Tamkang University
#### SUMMARY
* Thesis: Using machine learning techniques to find the relationship between university admission score and student performance.       
* Purpose: To provide an objective insight for our department on admission.       
* Method: Using 3 machine learning models (Deep Neural Network, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) by Python Packages (Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn) to predict studentsâ€™ performance.      

#### MODELS INTRODUCTION
* Deep Neural Network (DNN)

>* Input layer: To receive incoming messages.      
>* Hidden layer: Located in the middle of the input and output layers, it consists of numerous neurons and connections.       
>* Output layer: The output result of the transmission, analysis, and trade-off of information in a neuron link.

> It contains weight, sum, and active function. After the input is weighted, the results are converted to nonlinear through the active function and passed to the next layer.           
>          
> Let's see the operating process of DNN. <br />

> * This is called forward propagation from the input layer passing through the hidden layer and the output layer to the loss function.     
> * The loss function is used to describe the difference between the predicted value and the real value.
> * The new weight is calculated by the optimizer to update back, which is called reverse propagation.
* Random Forest (RF)
> The random forest is composed of multiple cart decision trees.
> Zoom in the decision trees, take an example as flollow.

# Master Thsis in Computer Science at Tamkang University
#### SUMMARY
* Thesis: Using machine learning techniques to find the relationship between university admission score and student performance.
* Purpose: To provide an objective insight for our department on admission.
* Method: Using 3 machine learning models (Deep Neural Network, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) by Python Packages (Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn) to predict studentsâ€™ performance. <br>

#### MODELS
* Deep Neural Network (DNN) <br>

>* Input layer: To receive incoming messages 
>* Hidden layer: Located in the middle of the input and output layers, it consists of numerous neurons and connections
>* Output layer: The output result of the transmission, analysis, and trade-off of information in a neuron link 
> Zoom in the neurons and connections<br>
